# Linear-Time Gaussian Processes Using Binary Tree Kernels

## Getting started


From the base `efficient_gps` directory run:

`pip install -e .`

## Structure

The experiments can be run using the ipython notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory (specifically, the notebooks ending in `_160_raw_samps.ipynb`)

## UCI Data
The required uci datasets can be downloaded here:
`https://file.io/ZK2fu0zOwZYp`

The resulting `data.zip` file should be placed in the base `efficient_gp` directory and unzipped.

## Running Experiments

Open and run the notebooks ending in `_160_raw_samps.ipynb`.
